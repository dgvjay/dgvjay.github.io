I am fascinated by biology at the molecular level. The key to some of the most pressing challenges in healthcare lies in a thorough understanding of the molecular basis of life-forming biomolecular complexes. The two critical components of the molecular basis are how these complexes work in real-time (i.e., their function and assembly) and what they look like at the molecular or submolecular level (Structural Biology). Good knowledge of these two components enhances our understanding of fundamental biology. Furthermore, this understanding gives us a blueprint for the therapeutic strategies to control/manage the behavior of these complexes and, in turn, the fate of the cell/organism itself. 

Investigating these dual components is akin to playing legos at the molecular level, i.e., a play of seeing which parts of a complex are joined together or interact and what they look like. For investigations into these dual components, I specialize in the following two techniques:
<ul>
  <li>Single-molecule biophysics</li>
  <li>Cryo-electron microscopy, chiefly the <em>In situ</em> tomography using cryo-focused ion beam milling</li>
</ul>
