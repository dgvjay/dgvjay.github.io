I am interested in molecular photography (capturing molecular structures and their locations) and molecular videography (observing what molecules do and how). My goal is to develop platforms that advance molecular discoveries and therapies. I specialize in managing photons (light microscopy) and electrons (electron microscopy) and managing bits (i.e., the data from these microscopies, aka image processing).
