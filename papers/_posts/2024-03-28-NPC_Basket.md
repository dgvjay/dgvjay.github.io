# Abstract 
The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is the sole mediator of nucle- ocytoplasmic transport. Despite great advances in understand- ing its conserved core architecture, the peripheral regions can exhibit considerable variation within and between species. One such structure is the cage-like nuclear basket. Despite its crucial roles in mRNA surveillance and chromatin organization, an ar- chitectural understanding has remained elusive. Using in-cell cryo-electron tomography and subtomogram analysis, we ex- plored the NPCâ€™s structural variations and the nuclear basket across fungi (yeast; S. cerevisiae), mammals (mouse; M. muscu- lus), and protozoa (T. gondii). Using integrative structural mod- eling, we computed a model of the basket in yeast and mam- mals that revealed how a hub of Nups in the nuclear ring binds to basket-forming Mlp/Tpr proteins: the coiled-coil domains of Mlp/Tpr form the struts of the basket, while their unstructured termini constitute the basket distal densities, which potentially serve as a docking site for mRNA preprocessing before nucleo- cytoplasmic transport.
