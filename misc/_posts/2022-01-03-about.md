# About this site

This website is adapted from an excellent open-source template from the [Drummond Lab](http://drummondlab.org/){:target="_blank"}, which itself was inspired from [Bedford Lab](https://bedford.io/){:target="_blank"}. I used a version by [Navish Wadhwa](https://navishwadhwa.com/){:target="_blank"} and modified it accordingly. The source code of my website is available in my [Github repository](https://github.com/dgvjay/dgvjay.github.io){:target="_blank"}, which you can freely clone to create your website. If you do, I suggest that you include attribution to all the sources.
